# Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the challenge portfolio?
# My name is Elena. I took part in the project because it is a chance to get hands-on experience in QA Automated Testing. The project provides an opportunity to communicate with mentors and all project participants, as well as get feedback from experts in this field, which means acquiring new knowledge.
