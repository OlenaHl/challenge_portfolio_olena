# Task 1: Software configuration
## Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the challenge portfolio?
My name is Elena. I took part in the project because it is a chance to get hands-on experience in QA Automated 
Testing. The project provides an opportunity to communicate with mentors and all project participants, as well as get
feedback from experts in this field, which means acquiring new knowledge.
